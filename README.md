# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

An improvement for the project that would be useful is to make functioning social media links intstead of only having placeholders. This would create more social media engagement therefore, bringing more traffic to the website.

I also think that making the background of the webiste more uniform instead of distinct portions with different backgrounds would be more pleasing to the average person.
